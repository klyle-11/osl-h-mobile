[← Scroll Up] [Continuous Scroll] [Scroll Down →]
```
- Shows entire EPUB content in one scrollable view
- Navigation buttons scroll to chapter positions
- Perfect for reading long books without interruption

### **Paginated Mode**
```
[📖 Page] Chapter 2 / 5  
[← Previous Chapter] [Page 2 of 5] [Next Chapter →]
```
- Shows one chapter at a time
- Navigation buttons switch between chapters
- Great for structured reading and note-taking

## 🎮 User Controls

### **View Mode Button** 
- 📜→📖 Click to switch from Scroll to Page mode
- 📖→📜 Click to switch from Page to Scroll mode
- Located in the header next to chapter info

### **Navigation Buttons**
- **In Continuous Mode**: Scroll to previous/next chapter position
- **In Paginated Mode**: Switch to previous/next chapter page
- **Smart Disabling**: Buttons disable at start/end of book

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Chapter Content Splitting**
```typescript
// Splits EPUB HTML by TOC headers
const splitContentByChapters = (content: SimpleEPUBContent): string[]
```
- Uses table of contents to identify chapter boundaries
- Extracts individual chapter HTML content
- Maintains original formatting and styling

### **Navigation State Management**
```typescript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'continuous' | 'paginated'>('continuous');
const [currentChapter, setCurrentChapter] = useState(0);
const [chapterContents, setChapterContents] = useState<string[]>([]);
```
- Tracks current viewing mode and chapter
- Manages split chapter content for paginated view
- Handles scrolling references for continuous mode

### **Smart Content Display**
```typescript
{viewMode === 'continuous' ? (
    // Show all content with chapter scroll positions
) : (
    // Show current chapter content only
)}
```
- Conditionally renders content based on view mode
- Preserves HTML formatting in both modes
- Maintains text selection functionality

## 🎉 Result

Your EPUB viewer now provides:
- ✅ **Functional Navigation**: Buttons actually move through the book
- ✅ **Reading Flexibility**: Choose between scroll or page-based reading
- ✅ **Proper Chapter Handling**: Respects EPUB structure and table of contents
- ✅ **Enhanced UX**: Clear visual feedback and progress tracking
