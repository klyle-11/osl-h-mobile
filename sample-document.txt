This is a sample document for testing the highlighting and annotation features of the app.

Here is some text that can be highlighted and annotated. You can select individual words or phrases to create highlights.

When you tap on a word, it will be selected. When you tap on another word, it will create a selection range that can be saved as a highlight.

Once text is highlighted, you can tap on the highlighted text to add annotations and comments.

This system allows for persistent storage of highlights and annotations that will be saved across app sessions.

The app supports both PDF and EPUB documents, though this is a simple text example for demonstration purposes.
